  body: 'Final Project for Code Fellows 201. Team Inevitable Mortality by Brandon Parker, Carson Parker, Sawako Ishida, Melissa Giaime. Our team project is a mad-lib to \'predict\' your death. It is not for children. The stories were written complete, and we later determined which words would make the stories the most ridiculous as possible when replaced with random nouns, verbs, or adjectives. We put together a function that would allow the mad-libs to be filled in by the user input that would transfer the input from local storage on the front page to the results page and populate the correct empty array with each word submitted.',
